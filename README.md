# Calculator-
<h1>My calculator was built with HTML, CSS, & JavaScript!</h1>

<h3>My calculator has a 15 var limit to prevent any crashes, it will say 'OverFlow' once its limit has been reached. If you enter a number and then a operation, any operation selected directly after will replace the most recent operation. This is a function most calculators have. For example if you click "3+" and then "-", the addition symbol will be replaced with the subtraction symbol. My calculator also has a refresh and decimal button, and everything is rounded to two decimals. </h3>
